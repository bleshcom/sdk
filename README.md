# Blesh SDK

This documentation is targeted for developers who are already in our development program. For more information and business inquiries please visit us at https://www.blesh.com

Blesh SDK is distributed as a library project for iOS and Android platforms. It's core purpose is to provide micro location information to the host application via our services. These services vary from displaying feature-rich content to simple micro location information. All you should do is to start our SDK, providing user specific settings dedicated to your application which you can obtain by contacting us. Therefore we have a quite simple integration phase and we are doing our best to keep it that way.

## Integrating Blesh SDK into your application

Integration process involves importing Blesh SDK library project into your application and starting Blesh SDK. Please refer to our platform specific guides for more detail.
